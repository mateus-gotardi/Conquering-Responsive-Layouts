# About this repository

This repository is for storage and share my results in the # [Conquering Responsive Layouts](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts) couse by Kevin Powell, the mage of CSS, i'll add my results in one folder for each day of the challenge and a little explanation and comments about each one here in the read-me file.

## Day one

The first challenge is about width and height in css, it was pretty simple and takes me about one minute to be done.
What I could learn with this challenge is the idea that using % in css makes the container size change following the size of it's parent and using fixed values in CSS can be problematical to it's responsiveness, although using a fixed height it's not recommended at all.

## Day two

Day two was about rem and em units that reference the font sizes, there is no challenge for this day

## Day three

Day three is about max-width, in order to get better design and harmony to the design, because in larger screens sizes have the text crossing all the screen can be awkward to read
So day three challenge was a little more difficult because there was missing parts on the html and some miss placed css, but i accomplished to conclude the challenge

## Day four

Day four it's a extra content day, about CSS viewport Units vh, vw, vmin and vmax

- 100vw or 100vh its equal to 100% of the ciewport of the user
- vmin represents the smaller of vh and vw. It is equal to 1% of the smaller dimension (either height or width) of the viewport. For example, if the viewport's width is 800 pixels and the height is 600 pixels, 1vmin would be 6 pixels (1% of 600 pixels).
- vmax represents the larger of vh and vw. It is equal to 1% of the larger dimension (either height or width) of the viewport. For example, if the viewport's width is 800 pixels and the height is 600 pixels, 1vmax would be 8 pixels (1% of 800 pixels).

## Day Five

In this Day a figma layout is provided to copy, the challenge is about using the units learned in the previous days to copy the layout, the layout is a simple one, but it's a good practice to use the units and get used to them.
