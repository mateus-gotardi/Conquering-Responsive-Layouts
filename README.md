## Day one

The first challenge is about width and height in css, it was prety simple and takes me about one minute to be done.
What I could learn with this challenge is the idea that using % in css makes the container size change following the size of it's parent and using fixed values in CSS can be problematical to it's responsiveness, althoug using a fixed height it's not recomended at all.
